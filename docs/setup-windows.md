```

> This will allow you to execute PowerShell scripts locally on your machine.

## Chocolatey

In PowerShell as Administrator:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

Close and reopen PowerShell after that.

During installation select C++ desktop development and latest Windows 10 SDK. 

After installation open Visual Studio and check for updates. Install the latest 2022 version that is available.
